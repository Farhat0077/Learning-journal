              <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
              <p>
                I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
                and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I
                learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I
                was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
              </p>
              <h2>How I got started</h2>
              <p>
                I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would
                take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd
                use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write
                short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
              </p>
              <p>
                That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting
                my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay
                motivated.
